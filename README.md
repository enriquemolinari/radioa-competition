# RadioA - Competitions Module

This is the Competitions Java9+ Module of the RadioA sample application written as a demostration of the modular architecture for the book [Coding an Architecture Style](https://leanpub.com/codinganarchitecturestyle). See also the others three modules [Notifications Module](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/radioa-notifications), [UserProfile Module](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/radioa-userprofile) and [Main Module](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/radioa-main). 

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
